# III-KULEUVEN-2024

## Introduction
This project involves designing a comprehensive IoT system from the sensor/actuator to the cloud combining hardware and software components. The focus is on creating a well-designed, secure, reliable, and performant system, applying the design principles learned in III lectures and prior classes.

## Goal
This project combines hardware and software components to build a robust IoT system, enhancing our understanding of distributed systems, secure communication, and real-time data management. 

### Disclaimer
The code will be uploaded soon, for legal matters.

## Grade
Our project received a grade of 2/4.  
This is because we experienced some problems with the BLE and could only make it work independently with each part and not all together, it was a matter of time shortage.
